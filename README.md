# 📚 Grokking DSA – My Algorithm Learning Playground

Welcome to my little corner of code chaos (…the organized kind)!  
This repository is where I’m documenting my journey through the book **"Grokking Algorithms"** — one problem, one aha! moment, and probably several “wait… what?” moments at a time.

I’m writing every example and exercise in **both Python 🐍 and JavaScript 🟨**, so you’ll see how the same idea plays out in two different languages.  
Think of it as bilingual DSA training — because why not?

## 📂 What’s Inside

- **Python Implementations** – Clean, readable, sometimes heavily commented when I forget what’s happening.
- **JavaScript Implementations** – For those times when I need curly braces in my life.
- **Algorithms & Data Structures** – In the order they appear in the book, so you can follow along step-by-step.

---

## 🧠 Why This Exists

- To **learn** DSA concepts deeply (and have code receipts for future me).
- To **compare** Python vs JavaScript approaches side-by-side.
- To **share** progress — because teaching/sharing helps me remember.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
   ```
2. Open your favorite DSA folder:
   - `dsa_name.py` → Python code
   - `dsa_name.js` → JavaScript code
3. Run & experiment:

   ```bash
   # Python
   python dsa_name.py

   # JavaScript
   node dsa_name.js
   ```

## 📖 Book Reference

This work is based on **"Grokking Algorithms" by Aditya Bhargava**.  
If you haven’t read it yet… you’re missing out. It’s the friendliest algorithm book I’ve met so far.

## 🌱 Current Status

- Working through chapters in order
- Updating as I code along
- Refactoring when I realize chapter 1 code could have been cleaner 🙃

## ✨ About Me

Hi, I’m Tioluwani — a curious developer who enjoys:

- Writing code that my future self can _hopefully_ understand
- Learning new ways to think about problem solving
- Occasionally talking to algorithms like they’re real people (don’t judge)

## 🛠️ Contributions

This is mostly a personal learning repo, but if you’ve got improvements, tips, or a better way to explain something — PRs are welcome! Just keep it beginner-friendly.

## 📅 Progress Tracker

- ✅ Chapter 1: Binary Search and Travelling Salesperson
- ✅ Chapter 2: Selection Sort
- 🚧 Chapter 3: Recursion
- 🔜 The rest… stay tuned.

**Happy Grokking!** 🎉
